# Self Guided: Practicing What I have learned (website with cone)


## Overview

Welcome! This is a project that I created while working on the curriculum for the Full-Stack Engineering Path on Codecademy.

This is one of my first projects I created to practice using Visual Studio Code and the concepts I have learn so far in the program I am enrolled in. As I learn more I will continue to edit this project.


## Features
- **Color Palette**: I used a color palette that I created to ensure a pleasant viewing experience.
- **Audio**: I learned on my own how to add music to the page, added it to test out how it would go.
- **Display**: Tested out how display would work. 
- **Float**: In on of the sections I used the float to see how the images would would be position on the page.
- **Table**: Added a table to practice using one.
- **Skeuomorphic Buttons**: I designed skeuomorphic style buttons to see how they would look.



## Status
- Complete for now.
- Will make responsive using relative units (rem, em, %, etc).
- Will add the usage of flexbox / grid

## Languages
